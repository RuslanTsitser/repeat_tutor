# You are a senior product designer creating a high-conversion onboarding for a mobile language learning app

Product name: Repeat Tutor  
Platform: iOS / Android (mobile-first)

This onboarding is part of a sales funnel, not just product introduction.
Each screen must reduce user anxiety, increase perceived value, and move the user closer to subscribing.

TARGET USER  
Adults 25–45 learning a foreign language for work, travel, or personal growth.
They are afraid of speaking, making mistakes, and being judged.
They doubt AI learning effectiveness and don’t have time or money for tutors.

Safe speaking practice with an AI tutor using repetition:
AI speaks → user translates and speaks → gentle correction → repetition → confidence.
